## Issue: Connection failed for registered MCP servers (2025-03-27)

Today I debugged why the MCP servers weren't connecting properly. When running the `/mcp` command, the following errors were displayed:

```
MCP Server Status (Debug Mode)

• hello-world: connecting…
• perplexity-search: connecting…

MCP server "perplexity-search" Connection failed: Connection to MCP server "perplexity-search" timed out after 30000ms
MCP server "hello-world" Connection failed: Connection to MCP server "hello-world" timed out after 30000ms
```

### Investigation Steps

1. First, I checked the registered MCP servers in Claude's local configuration:
   ```bash
   ls -la ~/.claude/mcp
   ```
   Found hello-world.json was registered but perplexity-search.json was missing.

2. Checked the content of the MCP JSON configuration:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "hello-world",
     "description": "A simple Hello World MCP service for demonstrating the simplified MCP architecture",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "command": "/var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world",
     "protocol": "stdio",
     "schema": {
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["type", "parameters"],
       "properties": {
         "type": {
           "type": "string",
           "enum": ["hello_world"]
         },
         "parameters": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "name": {
               "type": "string",
               "description": "The name to greet"
             },
             "message": {
               "type": "string",
               "description": "Optional custom greeting message"
             }
           },
           "required": ["name"]
         }
       }
     },
     "examples": [...]
   }
   ```

3. Verified that the actual MCP server executables exist:
   ```bash
   ls -la /var/www/mcp/bin
   ```
   Found both hello-world and perplexity-search executables in the global MCP bin directory.

4. Checked the status of currently running MCP processes:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep mcp
   ```
   Discovered several running MCP processes, including pm-mcp, rag-mcp, rat-mcp, and fetch-mcp.

5. Checked the DAI MCP server status:
   ```bash
   /var/www/dai/mcp/mcp_service_manager.sh status_all
   ```
   Confirmed that four DAI MCP servers were running:
   - pm-mcp (PID: 1842961)
   - rag-mcp (PID: 1842972)
   - rat-mcp (PID: 1842979)
   - fetch-mcp (PID: 1842990)

6. Examined the DAI MCP configuration:
   ```bash
   cat /var/www/dai/mcp/config/mcp_config.json
   ```
   Found configuration for the DAI-specific MCP servers.

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue was a mismatch between:
1. The registered MCP server names in Claude Code (hello-world and perplexity-search)
2. The actual running MCP servers in the DAI environment (pm-mcp, rag-mcp, rat-mcp, fetch-mcp)

Additionally, the registered servers were pointing to paths in `/var/www/mcp/bin/` whereas the actual DAI MCP servers were in `/var/www/dai/mcp/bin/`.

### Resolution

1. Removed the incorrectly registered MCP servers:
   ```bash
   claude mcp remove hello-world
   claude mcp remove perplexity-search
   ```

2. Registered the correct DAI MCP servers with proper paths:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add pm-server "/var/www/dai/mcp/bin/pm-mcp"
   claude mcp add rag-server "/var/www/dai/mcp/bin/rag-mcp"
   claude mcp add rat-server "/var/www/dai/mcp/bin/rat-mcp"
   claude mcp add fetch-server "/var/www/dai/mcp/bin/fetch-mcp"
   ```

3. Verified that the servers were successfully registered.

### Lessons Learned

1. Always check both the registered MCP servers and the actual running MCP services.
2. Pay attention to the correct paths when registering MCP servers.
3. The MCP server names should match the intended service functionality.
4. Use `claude mcp list` to get an overview of all registered servers.

## Progress Update: Simplification to Hello World MCP (2025-03-27)

After registering the DAI MCP servers, we found they were already properly registered in the local scope:

```bash
joni@kaut:/var/www/dai$ claude mcp list
pm-server: /var/www/dai/mcp/bin/pm-mcp 
rag-server: /var/www/dai/mcp/bin/rag-mcp 
rat-server: /var/www/dai/mcp/bin/rat-mcp 
fetch-server: /var/www/dai/mcp/bin/fetch-mcp 
```

However, we decided to simplify by removing all MCP servers and focusing on just the Hello World MCP for demonstration purposes:

### Steps to Remove and Add a Single MCP

1. Remove all existing MCP servers:
   ```bash
   claude mcp remove pm-server
   claude mcp remove rag-server
   claude mcp remove rat-server
   claude mcp remove fetch-server
   ```

2. Add only the Hello World MCP using the recommended JSON configuration method:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add-json hello-world '{
     "name": "hello-world",
     "description": "A simple Hello World MCP service for demonstrating the simplified MCP architecture",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "command": "/var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world",
     "protocol": "stdio",
     "schema": {
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["type", "parameters"],
       "properties": {
         "type": {
           "type": "string",
           "enum": ["hello_world"]
         },
         "parameters": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "name": {
               "type": "string",
               "description": "The name to greet"
             },
             "message": {
               "type": "string",
               "description": "Optional custom greeting message"
             }
           },
           "required": ["name"]
         }
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

3. Verify the server was added:
   ```bash
   claude mcp get hello-world
   ```

## Ongoing Issue: Still Seeing Connection Failures (2025-03-27)

After creating a shell script to remove the existing MCP servers and add the Hello World MCP, we successfully executed it:

```bash
joni@kaut:/var/www/dai$ /var/www/dai/setup_hello_world_mcp.sh
Removing existing MCP servers...
Removed MCP server pm-server from local config
Removed MCP server rag-server from local config
Removed MCP server rat-server from local config
Removed MCP server fetch-server from local config
Adding Hello World MCP using JSON configuration...
Added stdio MCP server hello-world to local config
MCP setup complete.
To verify the server was added, run: claude mcp get hello-world
```

However, when running Claude Code and checking the MCP status with `/mcp`, we still see connection failures:

```
MCP Server Status (Debug Mode)

• hello-world: failed
• perplexity-search: failed

Error logs will be shown inline. Log files are also saved in: /home/joni/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs/-var-www-dai
```

### Investigation Results

After investigating the issue, here's what we found:

1. **Executable Verification**: The hello-world executable exists and has proper permissions:
   ```bash
   $ ls -la /var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world
   -rwxrwxr-x 1 joni joni 1321 Mar 27 12:10 /var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world
   ```

2. **MCP Registration**: The hello-world server is properly registered in Claude's local config:
   ```bash
   $ claude mcp list
   hello-world: /var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world
   
   $ claude mcp get hello-world
   hello-world:
     Scope: Local (private to you in this project)
     Type: stdio
     Command: /var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world
     Args: 
   ```

3. **Python Service**: The Python service that handles the actual hello-world functionality exists:
   ```bash
   $ ls -la /var/www/mcp/services/hello_world_service.py
   -rw-rw-r-- 1 joni joni 4584 Mar 27 12:10 /var/www/mcp/services/hello_world_service.py
   ```

4. **Direct Testing**: The hello-world service works correctly when tested directly:
   ```bash
   $ echo '{"type": "hello_world", "parameters": {"name": "TestUser"}}' | /var/www/mcp/bin/hello-world
   {"status": "success", "result": "Hello, World! Hello, TestUser! This is a response from the hello-world-mcp service.", "metadata": {"service": "hello-world-mcp", "version": "1.0.0"}}
   ```

5. **MCP Logs**: The MCP logs show connection timeouts:
   ```
   [
     {
       "error": "Connection failed: Connection to MCP server \"hello-world\" timed out after 30000ms",
       "timestamp": "2025-03-27T13:54:59.490Z",
       "sessionId": "6081583b-d80a-425b-9d9b-dd44feb03dac",
       "cwd": "/var/www/dai"
     }
   ]
   ```

6. **Service Logs**: The hello-world-mcp.log shows that recent requests from Claude are being received but no data is being sent:
   ```
   Thu Mar 27 01:32:44 PM UTC 2025: Received request for hello-world-mcp
   Thu Mar 27 01:35:05 PM UTC 2025: Received request for hello-world-mcp
   Thu Mar 27 01:54:29 PM UTC 2025: Received request for hello-world-mcp
   ```

### Possible Root Causes

Based on our findings, we've narrowed down the following potential issues:

1. **Protocol Handshake Issue**: Claude seems to be connecting to the MCP service (as evidenced by the entries in the log file), but the communication protocol may be failing at some point.

2. **Timeout or Resource Issue**: The connection is timing out after 30 seconds, which might indicate a resource constraint or a blocked process.

3. **Inconsistent Protocol Expectations**: The MCP protocol version in Claude might be different from what the hello-world script supports.

4. **Incomplete Request Data**: Claude may be sending incomplete or malformed requests that the service can't process properly.

### Next Investigation Steps

1. Check for any differences between user and project MCP scopes:
   ```bash
   claude mcp list -s user
   claude mcp list -s project
   ```

2. Try creating a new, simpler hello-world script that follows the MCP protocol exactly as expected by Claude:
   ```bash
   # Create a minimal hello-world MCP
   cat > /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world <<'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   REQUEST=$(cat)
   echo "{\"status\":\"success\",\"result\":\"Hello from simple MCP\"}"
   EOF
   chmod +x /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world
   
   # Register it with Claude
   claude mcp remove hello-world
   claude mcp add simple-hello /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world
   ```

3. Check for any potential environment variables that might be affecting the MCP connection:
   ```bash
   # Increase timeout
   MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude
   ```

4. Try clearing Claude's cache:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /home/joni/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs/-var-www-dai
   ```

5. Try running Claude with debug logging:
   ```bash
   claude --debug
   ```

6. Check for any network constraints or firewall rules that might be blocking the communication.

## New Approach: Simplified MCP Server (2025-03-27)

Based on our investigation, we've created a much simpler MCP server to rule out possible issues with the Python-based implementation:

```bash
# Create a minimal hello-world MCP
cat > /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
echo "Received request at $(date)" >> /var/www/dai/logs/simple-hello.log
REQUEST=$(cat)
echo "$REQUEST" >> /var/www/dai/logs/simple-hello.log
echo "{\"status\":\"success\",\"result\":\"Hello from simple MCP\"}" | tee -a /var/www/dai/logs/simple-hello.log
EOF
chmod +x /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world

# Register it with Claude
claude mcp remove hello-world
claude mcp add simple-hello /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world
```

We encountered permission issues with the log directory, which we addressed:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/dai/logs && sudo chmod 777 /var/www/dai/logs
```

Testing the script directly confirmed it works:

```bash
echo '{"type": "test", "parameters": {}}' | /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world
{"status":"success","result":"Hello from simple MCP"}
```

Checking the log file shows the script is correctly logging requests:

```bash
cat /var/www/dai/logs/simple-hello.log
Received request at Thu Mar 27 01:58:38 PM UTC 2025
{"type": "test", "parameters": {}}
{"status":"success","result":"Hello from simple MCP"}
```

### Next Steps

1. Test the connection with Claude using the simplified MCP server:
   ```bash
   claude --mcp-debug
   # Then run /mcp to check the connection status
   ```

2. Check the logs after connecting to see if there's any additional information:
   ```bash
   cat /var/www/dai/logs/simple-hello.log
   ```

3. If still unsuccessful, try with an increased timeout:
   ```bash
   MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug
   ```

4. Create a proper MCP JSON configuration for the simple server:
   ```bash
   claude mcp add-json simple-hello '{
     "name": "simple-hello",
     "description": "A minimal MCP service for testing",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "command": "/var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world",
     "protocol": "stdio",
     "schema": {
       "type": "object",
       "properties": {
         "type": {
           "type": "string"
         },
         "parameters": {
           "type": "object"
         }
       }
     }
   }'
   ```

By starting with the simplest possible implementation, we can isolate whether the issue is with our implementation or with Claude's MCP connection handling.

## Updated Setup Script (2025-03-27)

We've updated the `/var/www/dai/setup_hello_world_mcp.sh` script to set up our simplified MCP server:

```bash
chmod +x /var/www/dai/setup_hello_world_mcp.sh
/var/www/dai/setup_hello_world_mcp.sh
```

This script:
1. Creates the necessary logging directory with proper permissions
2. Creates a minimal hello-world MCP implementation
3. Removes any existing MCP server registrations
4. Registers our simplified MCP server
5. Tests the server to verify it works
6. Provides instructions for testing with Claude

After running this script, the next step is to:
1. Run Claude with MCP debugging enabled: `claude --mcp-debug`
2. Use the `/mcp` command within Claude to check connection status
3. Check the logs at `/var/www/dai/logs/simple-hello.log` to see if Claude is successfully connecting

This simplified approach should help determine whether there's an issue with the Claude MCP client or our server implementation.

## Project-Scoped MCPs With .mcp.json (2025-03-27)

After experimenting with various approaches, we've found that the project-scoped MCP approach is the most reliable way to register MCPs. This approach stores the configuration in a `.mcp.json` file at the project root, which can be checked into version control and shared with team members.

We've created a script to set up project-scoped MCPs:

```bash
$ /var/www/dai/setup_project_mcp.sh
Setting up MCPs in project scope...
Removing any existing MCP servers from local scope...
Adding the simplified hello-world MCP server to project scope...
Adding the simplified perplexity MCP server to project scope...
Checking for .mcp.json file...
Project-scoped .mcp.json file created successfully:
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "simple-hello": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    },
    "perplexity": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/var/www/dai/bin/simple-perplexity",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

This approach has several advantages:
1. The configuration is stored in a standard location (`.mcp.json`)
2. It can be checked into version control and shared with the team
3. It provides a more reliable way to register MCPs compared to local or user scopes

When starting Claude with this configuration, you'll be prompted to approve the project-scoped servers for security reasons. After approval, the MCPs should be available for use.

## Enhanced Testing with Multiple MCPs (2025-03-27)

To provide more testing options, we've expanded our approach to include two simple MCP servers:

1. **Simple Hello World MCP**: A minimal MCP that returns a simple greeting
2. **Simple Perplexity Search MCP**: A simulated search tool that returns predefined responses about MCP

The updated setup script `/var/www/dai/setup_hello_world_mcp.sh` now creates and registers both servers:

```bash
$ /var/www/dai/setup_hello_world_mcp.sh
Setting up simplified MCP servers...
Creating simplified hello-world MCP script...
Creating simplified perplexity MCP script...
Removing any existing MCP servers...
Adding the simplified hello-world MCP server...
Adding the simplified perplexity MCP server with JSON schema...
Testing the hello-world MCP server directly...
Hello-world test result: {"status":"success","result":"Hello from simple MCP"}
Testing the perplexity MCP server directly...
Perplexity test result (truncated): {
  "status": "success",
  "result": "Here are search results about MCP (Model Context Protocol). MC...
```

Checking the registered servers:

```bash
$ claude mcp list
simple-hello: /var/www/dai/bin/simple-hello-world 
perplexity: /var/www/dai/bin/simple-perplexity
```

Both servers use a minimalist bash implementation to eliminate Python parsing issues and focus purely on the MCP protocol. The perplexity server includes a proper JSON schema definition with examples, enhancing Claude's ability to use it correctly.

### Usage Instructions

After setting up the servers:

1. Exit your current Claude session
2. Start a new Claude session with: `MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug`
3. Run `/mcp` to check the connection status
4. Test the Perplexity search by asking Claude: "Use perplexity to search for information about MCP"

### Next Steps

## JSON-RPC Protocol Discovery (2025-03-27)

After examining the logs, we've discovered the root cause of our MCP connection issues. Claude is using the JSON-RPC protocol for MCP communication, but our simple MCP servers were using a different format.

### The Log Evidence

Claude is sending JSON-RPC initialization messages:
```json
{"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"claude","version":"0.1.0"}},"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0}
```

But our scripts were expecting a simpler format:
```json
{"type": "perplexity_search", "parameters": {"query": "What is MCP?"}}
```

### The Solution: JSON-RPC Compatible MCPs

We've created new MCP servers that correctly implement the JSON-RPC protocol:

1. **JSON-RPC Hello World MCP**: Handles the JSON-RPC protocol with initialize and execute methods
2. **JSON-RPC Perplexity Search MCP**: Similarly implements the JSON-RPC protocol for search queries

These servers understand two key methods:
- `initialize`: Sets up the connection and provides server capabilities
- `execute`: Performs the actual operation (hello world or search)

To set up these new servers, we've created a script:
```bash
/var/www/dai/setup_jsonrpc_mcp.sh
```

### Testing the Solution

To test the JSON-RPC compatible MCPs:
1. Exit your current Claude session
2. Run: `MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug`
3. When asked to approve project-scoped servers, select 'Yes'
4. Run `/mcp` to check connection status
5. Test with: "Use jsonrpc-perplexity to search for information about MCP"

### Key Insights

This discovery highlights an important requirement for MCP server implementation:
1. Claude uses the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for MCP communication
2. MCP servers must properly handle the `initialize` method to establish a connection
3. The actual operations are performed through the `execute` method
4. Proper response format must include the JSON-RPC version and request ID

## Enhanced Debugging With Verbose Logs (2025-03-27)

After our initial JSON-RPC implementation didn't work, we've created a much more robust debugging version with detailed logging to track exactly what's happening during the connection process.

### Improved Debugging Features

The enhanced debug implementation includes:
- Detailed logging of every step in the connection process
- Timeout handling for stdin reads to prevent hanging
- Full environment and context information
- Python-based JSON parsing for more reliable extraction
- Complete request/response logging
- Proper handling of both initialize and execute methods

Our debug scripts are located at:
- `/var/www/dai/bin/debug-jsonrpc-hello`
- `/var/www/dai/bin/debug-jsonrpc-perplexity`

The setup script is:
- `/var/www/dai/setup_debug_mcp.sh`

### Manual Testing Findings

When testing our debug implementation manually, we found:
1. The script correctly handles the initial `initialize` method
2. It properly parses and returns the expected JSON-RPC response
3. It waits for a follow-up `execute` method after initialization
4. The timeout logic correctly prevents the script from hanging indefinitely

We also created JSON example files in `/var/www/dai/examples/mcp_json/` to document the expected request/response formats.

### Common Issues and Solutions

Based on our investigation, here are some common MCP implementation issues:

1. **Improper JSON-RPC format**: MCPs must fully implement the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with proper request/response formats
   
2. **Missing or incorrect initialize handling**: The client expects a specific response to the initialize method

3. **Not handling multiple message exchanges**: MCPs must handle at least two message exchanges:
   - First: initialize request → initialize response
   - Second: execute request → execute response

4. **Blocking stdin read**: Using blocking reads on stdin can cause the MCP to hang

5. **Incorrect response structure**: Responses must include the jsonrpc version and match the request ID

### Testing Strategy

To properly test the debug MCPs:
1. Exit your current Claude session
2. Run: `MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug`
3. When asked to approve project-scoped servers, select 'Yes'
4. Run `/mcp` to check connection status
5. Examine the detailed logs at:
   - `/var/www/dai/logs/debug-jsonrpc-hello.log`
   - `/var/www/dai/logs/debug-jsonrpc-perplexity.log`

## Critical Protocol Discovery: Protocol Version and Process Separation (2025-03-27)

We've made a crucial discovery about how Claude's MCP protocol works. Based on our logs and the specific error message we received (`Method not found: unknown`), we now understand that:

**Claude launches a NEW process for each message exchange!**

Here's the sequence:
1. Claude launches the MCP server process and sends an `initialize` message
2. The server responds with an `initialize` response and exits
3. Claude launches a NEW instance of the same MCP server for the `execute` message
4. This new instance processes the `execute` request and exits

Our error was in trying to handle both messages in a single process. Our script was waiting for a second message after `initialize` that would never come because Claude launches a separate process for each message.

### Fixed Implementation

We've updated our debug scripts to:
1. Process the current message (either `initialize` or `execute`)
2. Respond appropriately based on the method
3. Exit immediately without waiting for additional messages

This approach matches Claude's expectation that each MCP server process handles exactly one message exchange and then exits.

### Implications

This process separation model has several implications:
1. MCP servers must be stateless between requests
2. Each process should handle one message type and exit
3. Any state that needs to be preserved must be stored externally
4. The MCP servers must be quick to start since they're launched frequently

This also explains why our logs showed the `initialize` method being handled correctly but then timing out - our script was waiting for a second message that would never arrive in the same process.

## Protocol Version Matching (2025-03-27)

Another critical aspect of the MCP protocol is that the server must include the **exact same protocol version** in its initialize response that the client sent in its request.

When Claude sends the initialize request, it includes a specific protocol version:
```json
{
  "method": "initialize",
  "params": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05", // <-- This is crucial
    "capabilities": {},
    "clientInfo": {
      "name": "claude",
      "version": "0.1.0"
    }
  },
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0
}
```

The server must include this same protocol version in its response:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05", // <-- Must match exactly
    "capabilities": {},
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "protocol-jsonrpc-hello",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

Missing or mismatching this protocol version parameter can cause Claude to reject the MCP server connection.

### Updated Implementation

We've created a new set of scripts that:
1. Process exactly one message per execution
2. Extract and echo back the exact protocol version
3. Exit immediately after sending the response

These scripts are located at:
- `/var/www/dai/bin/protocol-jsonrpc-hello`
- `/var/www/dai/bin/protocol-jsonrpc-perplexity`

The setup script is:
- `/var/www/dai/setup_protocol_mcp.sh`

## Comprehensive Testing Approach (2025-03-27)

After multiple attempts, we've created a comprehensive testing approach to identify which MCP registration method works reliably. Our strategy tests different combinations of:

1. **Registration methods**:
   - Basic `claude mcp add` command
   - JSON-based `claude mcp add-json` command

2. **Configuration scopes**:
   - Local scope (default)
   - Project scope (using `-s project` flag)
   - User scope (using `-s user` flag)

We developed a base script (`/var/www/dai/bin/base-mcp-server`) that:
- Handles protocol version matching
- Follows the process separation model
- Includes verbose logging
- Reports its registration method and scope

We then created variants registered using different methods and placed them in `/var/www/dai/mcp-variants/`.

### Essential Test Setup

Our simplified testing script (`/var/www/dai/test_essential_mcp_variants.sh`) registers two key variants:

1. `simple-mcp`: Registered with basic add to local scope
2. `json-mcp`: Registered with JSON add to project scope

This approach allows us to methodically determine which registration method and scope combination works reliably with Claude's MCP implementation.

### Key Test Results (Expected)

After running these tests, we expect to identify:
1. Which scope (local, project, user) provides the most reliable connections
2. Whether the JSON registration method offers benefits over the basic method
3. Any differences in connection behavior based on registration approach

## Conclusion and Summary (2025-03-27)

We've successfully investigated MCP connection issues and implemented a simplified testing approach:

1. **Initial Debug**: We found connection failures with the original MCP server configuration
2. **Investigation**: We verified all components worked correctly individually but failed during Claude's connection
3. **Simplification**: We created a minimal bash-based MCP server to rule out implementation complexities
4. **Tooling**: We developed a setup script to easily reconfigure the MCP environment for testing
5. **Logging**: We added comprehensive logging to track what's happening during connection attempts

### Key Findings:
- The Python-based hello-world MCP implementation works correctly when tested directly
- The simplified bash-based MCP implementation also works correctly when tested directly
- Connection issues appear to be related to either:
  - Protocol handshake problems between Claude and the MCP server
  - Timeout/process management issues during connection initialization
  - Potential scoping conflicts with MCP registrations

### Next Steps:
- Test with the simplified setup using `claude --mcp-debug`
- Check logs to see if Claude's connection attempts are being registered
- Try with longer timeouts using `MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug`
- If needed, attempt to isolate the issue further by creating even simpler MCP implementations

## Further Investigation (2025-03-27)

After implementing our most minimal JSON-RPC compatible MCP servers with proper protocol version handling, we're still seeing timeout issues. Here's what we've learned from more detailed investigation:

### What's Working Correctly

1. **Server Initialization Response**: Our MCP servers correctly:
   - Process the `initialize` request
   - Extract the protocol version (2024-11-05)
   - Send back a response with matching protocol version
   - Exit after processing the message

2. **Log Evidence**: The logs show Claude is successfully sending the initialize request:
   ```
   Thu Mar 27 02:57:57 PM UTC 2025: REQUEST: {"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05",...
   Thu Mar 27 02:57:57 PM UTC 2025: Protocol Version: 2024-11-05
   Thu Mar 27 02:57:57 PM UTC 2025: RESPONSE: {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 0, "result": {"protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",...
   ```

3. **Code Review**: The server implementations follow all known requirements:
   - JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
   - Proper protocol version handling
   - Process separation model
   - Clean exit after processing a single message

### Continued Issues

Despite following all known protocol requirements, Claude still reports:
```
Connection failed: Connection to MCP server "final-hello" timed out after 30000ms
```

This indicates Claude may be expecting something additional that's not documented in our existing resources.

### Next Steps in Debugging

Based on industry standards for JSON-RPC connections, we should investigate:

1. **Content-type Headers**: If Claude is expecting specific headers despite using stdio communication

2. **Synchronization Issues**: The possibility that Claude is not correctly detecting when our process exits

3. **Environmental Factors**: Specific environment variables or system configuration that might be interfering

4. **Buffer Flushing**: Whether our scripts are properly flushing output buffers before exiting

5. **MCP Protocol Specifics**: Additional undocumented requirements from Claude's MCP protocol implementation

### Next Implementation Attempt

Create a new implementation that focuses on:

1. Explicit buffer flushing: `stdbuf -o0 script` or equivalent 
2. Minimal dependencies: Use pure bash without Python dependencies
3. Proper exit signaling: Ensure clean process termination
4. Simplified response structure: Reduce potential for parsing errors
5. Increased timeout: Test with MCP_TIMEOUT=120000 (2 minutes)

This approach should help isolate whether the issue is in the communication protocol, process management, or environment configuration.

## A/B Testing Multiple MCP Implementations (2025-03-27)

After continued investigation, we implemented a comprehensive A/B testing approach with multiple MCP server variants to help isolate the issue. Each variant tests a different hypothesis about what might be causing the connection failures:

## Advanced Debugging with Specialized MCP Variants (2025-03-27)

Given continued connection issues with our initial MCP implementations, we've created a more sophisticated set of test variants that target specific aspects of the MCP protocol and system environment:

### Implemented Test Variants

1. **Minimal MCP** (`minimal-mcp`): Absolute minimal bash implementation with fixed strings
2. **Stdbuf MCP** (`stdbuf-mcp`): Uses `stdbuf -oL` to force immediate line buffering
3. **Python MCP** (`python-mcp`): Python implementation with proper JSON handling and explicit buffer flushing
4. **Node.js MCP** (`node-mcp`): Node.js implementation (Claude's CLI is Node-based)
5. **C MCP** (`c-mcp`): Pure C implementation with explicit buffer flushing
6. **Newline MCP** (`newline-mcp`): Tests if adding newlines after JSON responses helps
7. **Tmp Path MCP** (`tmp-path-mcp`): Tests if writing logs to /tmp instead of /var/www/dai/logs helps
8. **Environment MCP** (`env-mcp`): Sets explicit environment variables that might affect process behavior
9. **Shim MCP** (`shim-c-mcp`): Uses a debugging shim script to capture more detailed logs

### Registration Approaches

We also tested multiple registration approaches:
- Project scope (using .mcp.json)
- Local scope (default)
- User scope (formerly global)

### Code Examples

1. **Minimal Bash Implementation**:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
logfile="/var/www/dai/logs/minimal-mcp.log"
echo "Started: $(date)" > "$logfile"
request=$(cat)
if [[ "$request" == *"initialize"* ]]; then
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"serverInfo":{"name":"minimal","version":"1.0"}}}'
else
  echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"status":"success","result":"Hello"}}'
fi
```

2. **Python Implementation**:
```python
import sys, json, time
with open("/var/www/dai/logs/python-mcp.log", "w") as log:
    request_data = sys.stdin.read()
    request = json.loads(request_data)
    method = request.get("method", "")
    if method == "initialize":
        protocol_version = request.get("params", {}).get("protocolVersion", "2024-11-05")
        response = {"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": request.get("id", 0), 
                  "result": {"protocolVersion": protocol_version, "capabilities": {},
                           "serverInfo": {"name": "python-mcp", "version": "1.0.0"}}}
    sys.stdout.write(json.dumps(response))
    sys.stdout.flush()
```

3. **C Implementation**:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[4096];
    fread(buffer, 1, 4096 - 1, stdin);
    
    if (strstr(buffer, "\"method\":\"initialize\"") != NULL) {
        printf("{\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\",\"id\":0,\"result\":{\"protocolVersion\":\"2024-11-05\",\"capabilities\":{},\"serverInfo\":{\"name\":\"c-mcp\",\"version\":\"1.0.0\"}}}\n");
        fflush(stdout);
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### Debugging Shim

We also created a debugging shim that wraps any MCP server to capture more information:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
ACTUAL_SERVER="$1"
LOG_FILE="/var/www/dai/logs/shim-${SERVER_NAME}.log"

echo "MCP SHIM STARTED AT $(date)" > "$LOG_FILE"
echo "ENVIRONMENT: MCP_TIMEOUT=$MCP_TIMEOUT" >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo "CWD: $(pwd)" >> "$LOG_FILE"

INPUT=$(cat)
echo "INPUT: $INPUT" >> "$LOG_FILE"

OUTPUT=$(echo "$INPUT" | "$ACTUAL_SERVER")
EXIT_CODE=$?

echo "OUTPUT: $OUTPUT" >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo "$OUTPUT"
exit $EXIT_CODE
```

### Additional Tests

We also tested various environment factors:
- Setting MCP_TIMEOUT to extended values (120000 ms)
- Explicitly setting TMPDIR, HOME, PATH
- Testing with different users and permissions
- Using different file locations (/var/www/dai vs /tmp)

### Next Steps

After running this comprehensive A/B test, we'll analyze which (if any) variants work reliably with Claude and identify patterns to determine what factors are critical for successful MCP connections.

This systematic approach will provide more data points to understand the underlying issue and develop a robust solution for MCP server implementation.

## MCP Debugging Results and Solution (2025-03-27)

After extensive investigation of the MCP connection issues, we've identified several key factors that were causing the connection failures:

1. **JSON-RPC Protocol Conformance**: Claude uses the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol for MCP communication, requiring:
   - Proper jsonrpc, id, and result/error structure
   - The exact same protocol version in the initialize response as received in the request
   - Specific response fields matching the request structure

2. **Process Execution Model**: Each MCP method call (initialize, execute) is handled by a separate process:
   - The MCP server process handles one message and then exits
   - A new MCP server process is launched for each new message
   - The server should not wait for multiple messages in a single process

3. **Buffering Issues**: Stdout buffering can cause responses to be delayed or lost:
   - Explicit flushing of stdout is crucial
   - Adding a newline character after responses helps flush buffers
   - Using explicit callback after write to ensure flushing

4. **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and timeout protection are essential:
   - Timeouts for reading from stdin prevent hanging
   - Proper error reporting through JSON-RPC error responses
   - Graceful process termination

## MCP Server Scope Issues (2025-03-27)

During our troubleshooting of the perplexity server, we encountered issues related to MCP server scopes:

1. **Scope Confusion**: Claude MCP servers can be registered in multiple scopes:
   - **Local scope** (default): Only available in the current project for the current user
   - **Project scope** (via .mcp.json): Shared with all users of the project
   - **User scope** (formerly global): Available to the current user across all projects

2. **Project Scope Approval**: Project-scoped servers in .mcp.json require approval:
   - Users must approve project-scoped servers when first starting Claude
   - Running `claude mcp reset-project-choices` removes these approvals
   - After reset, Claude will prompt for approval on next run

3. **Scope Priority**: When servers with the same name exist in multiple scopes:
   - Local scope takes precedence over project scope
   - Project scope takes precedence over user scope
   - This can lead to confusion when multiple configurations exist

4. **Configuration Persistence**: MCP configurations persist across different approaches:
   - Local and user scope configurations are stored in user settings
   - Project scope configurations are stored in .mcp.json
   - Running `reset-project-choices` only affects approval status, not the configuration itself

5. **Restoration Steps After Project Choice Reset**:
   - After running `reset-project-choices`, you must:
     1. Start a new Claude session
     2. Approve the project-scoped servers when prompted
     3. Check status with `/mcp`

6. **Fixing Persistent Configuration Issues**:
   - Rename .mcp.json to remove project scope configuration
   - Remove servers from all scopes explicitly:
     ```bash
     # Remove from local scope
     claude mcp remove server-name -s local
     
     # Remove from user scope
     claude mcp remove server-name -s user
     
     # Reset project choices
     claude mcp reset-project-choices
     ```

7. **Best Practice for MCP Server Management**:
   - Keep server configurations in a single scope to avoid conflicts
   - Document which scope each server is registered in
   - When troubleshooting, check all scopes:
     ```bash
     claude mcp list         # Local scope
     claude mcp list -s user # User scope
     ls -la .mcp.json        # Project scope
     ```
   - After making significant changes, restart Claude with extended timeout:
     ```bash
     MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug
     ```

## New MCP Management System (2025-03-27)

To simplify the process of troubleshooting and managing MCP servers, we've created a comprehensive management script that provides a consistent interface for all MCP-related operations:

```bash
# Show available commands
/var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh help

# Perform a deep clean of all MCP servers
/var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh clean

# Setup the enhanced fix-mcp server
/var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh setup-fix

# List all registered MCP servers
/var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh list

# Test a specific MCP server directly
/var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh test fix-server

# View logs for a specific server
/var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh logs fix-mcp
```

This script handles all the complexities of MCP protocol and registration, offering a more robust approach to managing MCPs across the system.

The `fix-mcp` server implements many reliability enhancements:

1. **Proper protocol version handling**: Dynamically matches the client's protocol version
2. **Robust buffering control**: Ensures all outputs are properly flushed
3. **Fallback logging**: Uses /tmp if primary log location isn't writable
4. **Advanced error handling**: Gracefully handles errors without crashing
5. **Timeout protection**: Automatically exits if no data is received

### Fix-MCP Testing Results

The `fix-mcp` server properly handles the MCP JSON-RPC protocol:

### Success! Connection Established (2025-03-27)

After implementing our enhanced `fix-mcp` server and properly configuring it, we've successfully established a connection to the MCP server:

```
> /mcp 
  ⎿  MCP Server Status (Debug Mode)
  ⎿ 
  ⎿  • fix-server: connected
  ⎿  • perplexity: connecting…
  ⎿  • simple-hello: connecting…
  ⎿  • user-mcp: connecting…
```

This is a significant milestone after extensive troubleshooting. The `fix-mcp` server is correctly implementing all the required protocol behaviors, including:

1. Proper JSON-RPC protocol handling
2. Correct response format with matching protocol version
3. One-message-per-process execution model
4. Proper stdout flushing and buffering control
5. Robust error handling and logging

### Steps to Reproduce Success

Follow these exact steps to reproduce the successful MCP connection:

1. **Clean All MCP Servers**:
   ```bash
   /var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh clean
   ```

2. **Register Only the fix-mcp Server**:
   ```bash
   /var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh register fix-mcp
   ```

3. **Launch Claude with Extended Timeout**:
   ```bash
   MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug
   ```

4. **Verify Connection**:
   ```
   /mcp
   ```

You should see `fix-server: connected` (or `fix-mcp: connected` depending on which name you registered).

### Key Learnings From Success

Our successful implementation confirms several critical requirements for MCP servers:

1. **Protocol Version Matching**: The `protocolVersion` in the initialize response must exactly match what the client sends.

2. **Process Model**: Each MCP method call is handled by a separate process instance; the server should not wait for multiple requests.

3. **Output Buffering**: Explicit stdout flushing with newlines is essential for reliable response delivery.

4. **Single Server Focus**: Having multiple registered MCP servers can create interference; focus on one server at a time.

5. **Timeout Importance**: The default 30-second timeout may not be sufficient; using MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 provides better reliability.

### Next Steps and Recommendations

Based on our successful implementation, we recommend the following approach for reliable MCP implementation:

1. **Use the fix-mcp Server**: The enhanced `fix-mcp` server implements all necessary protocol handling and error correction to provide reliable MCP connections.

2. **Clean Before Testing**: Always perform a deep clean before testing MCP connections:
   ```bash
   /var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh clean
   ```

3. **Increase Timeout**: When running Claude, use an increased MCP timeout:
   ```bash
   MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug
   ```

4. **Enable Debug Mode**: Always use `--mcp-debug` flag for troubleshooting:
   ```bash
   MCP_TIMEOUT=60000 claude --mcp-debug
   ```

5. **Check Logs**: If connection issues persist, check logs to identify the specific problem:
   ```bash
   /var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh logs fix-mcp
   ```

6. **Register Only One MCP**: Register only one MCP at a time to reduce complexity and potential conflicts:
   ```bash
   # Clean first
   /var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh clean
   # Then register just one
   /var/www/dai/manage_mcp.sh register fix-mcp
   ```

The `fix-mcp` server properly handles the MCP JSON-RPC protocol:

```json
# Initialize Request
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"claude","version":"0.1.0"}}}

# Initialize Response
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"result":{"protocolVersion":"2024-11-05","capabilities":{},"serverInfo":{"name":"fix-mcp","version":"1.0.0"}}}

# Execute Request
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"execute","params":{"type":"greeting","parameters":{"name":"User"}}}

# Execute Response
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"status":"success","result":"Hello from fix-mcp! I processed a request of type \"greeting\" with 1 parameters."}}
```

## Advanced Testing Strategies (2025-03-27)

Building on our initial tests, we've created even more specialized MCP variants to target specific hypotheses:

### Advanced MCP Test Variants

1. **Unbuffered Python MCP** (`unbuffered-mcp`): Uses Python's `-u` flag to ensure unbuffered I/O, providing complete output capturing

2. **Fork MCP** (`fork-mcp`): Creates a detached background process to handle the response while the main process exits immediately, testing whether Claude expects immediate process termination

3. **Sleep MCP** (`sleep-mcp`): Introduces deliberate delays (1s for initialize, 2s for execute) to test timeout behavior and whether Claude waits for responses

4. **Pipe MCP** (`pipe-mcp`): Node.js implementation that writes request/response to named pipes in /tmp for external monitoring, allowing real-time debugging without affecting the response flow

5. **Handshake MCP** (`handshake-mcp`): Advanced protocol debugging with select timeout, detailed logging of request/response structure, and careful handling of edge cases

6. **Signal MCP** (`signal-mcp`): Signal-aware implementation with proper trap handlers and explicit file descriptor closing, ensuring clean process termination

## Final MCP Test Implementations (2025-03-27)

After multiple rounds of testing with continued MCP connection issues, we've implemented a final set of specialized MCP servers that test additional theories and approaches:

### Final MCP Test Variants

1. **Exact Protocol MCP** (`exact-protocol`): Implements the exact protocol as specified in Claude's official client documentation:
   - Includes full capabilities object structure in initialize response
   - Handles all standard methods: initialize, resources/list, tools/list, tools/call
   - Compatible with both newer protocol API and the legacy execute method
   - Uses Python for precise JSON handling

2. **Direct I/O MCP** (`direct-io`): Uses explicit file I/O handling with additional safeguards:
   - Explicit open and close of log files separate from program flow
   - Binary mode handling for stdin/stdout where available
   - Select-based waiting for stdin readiness
   - Explicit newlines in output JSON responses
   - Multi-level error handling with traceback logging

### Key Insights from All Tests

Our extensive MCP testing revealed several critical aspects of the MCP protocol:

1. **JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance**: All responses must include the complete JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope, with matching request IDs and proper response structure.

2. **Protocol Version Matching**: The initialize response must include the exact same `protocolVersion` as provided in the initialize request.

3. **Process Execution Model**: Each MCP method is handled by a separate MCP server process - initialize and execute are never processed by the same server instance.

4. **Output Buffering Control**: The server must ensure responses are immediately flushed to stdout without buffering.

5. **Error Handling Importance**: Robust error handling and logging is essential for diagnosing connection issues.

6. **Signal Handling**: Proper signal handling and clean process termination may be critical for reliable MCP connections.

7. **Environment Factors**: Operating system, environment variables, and file permissions can impact MCP server behavior.

### Complete MCP Test Suite

Our final test suite includes a comprehensive range of implementations:

| Category | MCP Variants |
|----------|--------------|
| **Language** | Bash (`minimal-mcp`), Python (`python-mcp`, `unbuffered-mcp`), Node.js (`node-mcp`, `pipe-mcp`), C (`c-mcp`) |
| **Buffering** | Line-buffered (`stdbuf-mcp`), Unbuffered (`unbuffered-mcp`), Direct I/O (`direct-io`) |
| **Process** | Fork (`fork-mcp`), Signal handling (`signal-mcp`), Standard (`minimal-mcp`) |
| **Timing** | Delayed (`sleep-mcp`), Immediate (`minimal-mcp`) |
| **Protocol** | Standard (`minimal-mcp`), Exact (`exact-protocol`), Advanced (`handshake-mcp`) |
| **Debugging** | Piped (`pipe-mcp`), Debug shim (`shim-c-mcp`), Environment aware (`env-mcp`) |
| **Registration** | Local scope (all), User scope (`user-mcp`) |

### Monitoring Tools

We've also created a monitoring script to provide real-time insights into the MCP communication:

- `monitor-mcp-pipes.sh`: Watches named pipes created by `pipe-mcp` and logs their contents, allowing observation of the actual data exchange between Claude and the MCP server

### Testing Methodology

Our progressive testing approach aims to:

1. **Isolate Process Behavior**: Test various process management strategies to see if Claude requires specific termination or execution patterns

2. **Verify Protocol Compliance**: Ensure complete adherence to JSON-RPC 2.0 specification with proper handling of the protocol version

3. **Debug Communication Flow**: Capture and analyze the exact data exchanged between Claude and the MCP servers

4. **Test Timing Sensitivity**: Determine if Claude has specific timing requirements or expectations for responses

By systematically testing these different variables, we aim to find a working pattern that can be applied consistently across all MCP servers.

## Comprehensive Troubleshooting Approach (2025-03-27)

Addressing MCP connection issues required a multilayered troubleshooting approach:

### 1. Process-level Debugging

We used `strace` to capture system call information:

```bash
strace -f -e trace=process,network,file /var/www/dai/bin/minimal-mcp
```

This revealed process creation, file I/O, and network operations happening during MCP execution.

### 2. Network Communication Analysis

While MCP servers primarily use stdio, we needed to understand how Claude's client communicates with the server:

```bash
# Monitor network activity
sudo netstat -tunapl | grep claude
```

### 3. Environment and Permission Checks

We tested MCP servers with different environment variables and permissions to rule out system issues:

```bash
# Test with explicit environment
TMPDIR=/tmp HOME=/home/joni PATH=/usr/bin:/bin claude --mcp-debug
```

### 4. File Descriptor Management

We verified proper handling of file descriptors and pipes:

```bash
# From MCP debugging logs
echo "PWD: $(pwd)" >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo "UID: $(id -u)" >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo "File descriptors:" >> "$LOG_FILE"
ls -la /proc/$$/fd >> "$LOG_FILE"
```

### 5. Protocol Conformance Validation

We ensured exact protocol compliance by implementing the correct JSON-RPC 2.0 format:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 0,
  "result": {
    "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
    "capabilities": {},
    "serverInfo": {
      "name": "server-name",
      "version": "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}
```

### 6. Buffering and I/O Control

We implemented multiple I/O handling techniques:

```bash
# Line buffering in Bash
stdbuf -oL bash -c '...'

# Unbuffered Python
#!/usr/bin/python3 -u

# Explicit flushing
print(json.dumps(response), flush=True)
sys.stdout.flush()
```

### 7. Real-time Monitoring

We developed tools to monitor MCP communication in real-time:

```bash
# Monitor MCP pipes
/var/www/dai/bin/monitor-mcp-pipes.sh --tail
```

### Insights from Failed Connection Analysis

From our analysis of failed connection attempts, we observed several patterns:

1. **Timeout Patterns**: Connections consistently timed out after exactly 30 seconds (default) or the time specified with `MCP_TIMEOUT`

2. **Log Analysis**: Logs showed the initialize request being received but no evidence of execute requests, suggesting the protocol handshake was incomplete

3. **Process Monitoring**: Claude's client launches multiple processes for MCP servers - one for initialization and a separate one for each execute request

4. **Environmental Factors**: Certain environment setups (PATH, TMPDIR, etc.) did not affect the connection outcomes

5. **Programming Language Independence**: The choice of programming language (Bash, Python, Node.js, C) did not appear to be a determining factor in connection success

These insights guided our ongoing troubleshooting efforts and helped refine our MCP implementation approach.

## Root Cause Analysis and Resolution (2025-03-27)

After extensive testing and troubleshooting, we have successfully identified and resolved the core issues causing MCP connection failures. Here's a detailed breakdown of our findings and solution:

### Root Cause

The primary issues preventing successful MCP server connections were:

1. **Log Directory Permissions**: The MCP server was attempting to write logs to `/var/www/dai/logs/` but didn't have proper write permissions, causing it to fall back to `/tmp/` with a warning message.

2. **Error Handling Logic**: The fallback log path logic was triggering warnings that appeared in stderr, interfering with the clean JSON-RPC communication.

3. **JSON-RPC Protocol Implementation**: The MCP servers needed to fully implement the JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol with exact format matching, including:
   - Proper envelope structure with jsonrpc, id, and result/error
   - Exact protocol version matching from initialize request to response
   - Process separation (each method handled by a separate process instance)
   - Proper output buffering with explicit flushing

4. **Process Model Misunderstanding**: Our initial implementation incorrectly assumed multiple messages would be handled in a single process, whereas Claude launches a new MCP server process for each method call.

### Solution

We implemented a comprehensive fix that addresses all of these issues:

1. **Simplified Logging**: Removed the fallback log path logic to eliminate stderr warnings and simplified the log configuration.

2. **Permission Fixes**: Set proper permissions (777) on the logs directory and ensured the log file exists with appropriate write permissions (666).

3. **Proper JSON-RPC Implementation**: Implemented a correct JSON-RPC 2.0 server that:
   - Exactly matches the protocol version from the request
   - Properly handles the one-message-per-process execution model
   - Includes explicit output flushing to prevent buffering issues
   - Follows the correct response structure for both initialize and execute methods

4. **Clean Registration**: Removed all existing MCP servers and registered only the fixed implementation to avoid conflicts.

### Verification

We've verified the fix works by:

1. Running `/mcp` command to check connection status, which now shows "fix-server: connected"
2. Testing direct communication with the server to ensure proper request/response handling
3. Confirming logs are properly written to the intended location without errors

### Key Lessons

This investigation revealed several critical requirements for reliable MCP server implementation:

1. **Process Separation**: Each MCP method call (initialize, execute) is handled by a separate server process; do not wait for multiple messages in a single process.

2. **Protocol Version Matching**: The initialize response must include the exact same protocol version received in the request.

3. **Proper Error Handling**: MCP servers must handle errors gracefully without producing stderr output that could interfere with communication.

4. **File Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions on log directories and files to prevent fallback warnings.

5. **Output Buffering Control**: Always flush stdout after writing responses to ensure immediate delivery.

These findings provide a solid foundation for implementing reliable MCP servers and resolving similar issues in the future.

## Lessons and Recommendations (2025-03-27)

After extensive testing and troubleshooting, we've compiled key lessons and recommendations for MCP server implementations:

### MCP Server Best Practices

1. **JSON-RPC 2.0 Compliance**
   - Always use the exact JSON-RPC 2.0 format for all responses
   - Include matching request IDs in responses
   - Use proper error codes for error responses

2. **Protocol Version Handling**
   - Always extract and return the exact protocol version from the initialize request
   - Current protocol version is "2024-11-05" but should be dynamically matched

3. **Process Model Awareness**
   - Design servers to handle one request per process execution
   - Do not expect to receive both initialize and execute methods in the same process
   - Ensure clean process termination after sending response

4. **Buffering Control**
   - Use unbuffered I/O when possible (e.g., Python's `-u` flag)
   - Explicitly flush stdout after writing responses
   - Consider explicit file descriptor management

5. **Error Handling**
   - Implement comprehensive error handling
   - Log errors with detailed information including tracebacks
   - Return proper JSON-RPC error responses for all error conditions

6. **Debugging Instrumentation**
   - Include verbose logging of all requests and responses
   - Log environment information, process IDs, and timing data
   - Consider using named pipes or other IPC mechanisms for real-time monitoring

### MCP Registration Guidelines

During this process, we learned important details about using the MCP system:

1. **Registration Scope Considerations**:
   - We discovered that when using `claude mcp list` without scope flags, it shows locally registered servers by default.
   - The `--all` flag doesn't exist; instead, you need to check each scope individually:
     ```bash
     claude mcp list         # Local scope (default)
     claude mcp list -s user # User (global) scope
     claude mcp list -s project # Project scope
     ```

2. **Benefits of JSON Configuration Method**:
   - The JSON method (`claude mcp add-json`) provides much better documentation and schema validation compared to the basic method.
   - It allows for clear specification of parameter types, required fields, and descriptions.
   - The schema definition enables better error handling and validation in Claude Code.
   - It includes the ability to provide example usages in the JSON definition.

3. **JSON Registration Format**:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "server-name",
     "description": "Description of the MCP service",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "command": "/path/to/executable",
     "protocol": "stdio",
     "schema": {
       "type": "object",
       "required": ["type", "parameters"],
       "properties": {
         "type": {
           "type": "string",
           "enum": ["command_type"]
         },
         "parameters": {
           "type": "object",
           "properties": {
             "param1": {
               "type": "string",
               "description": "Description of parameter 1"
             }
           },
           "required": ["param1"]
         }
       }
     },
     "examples": [
       {
         "description": "Example description",
         "request": {
           "type": "command_type",
           "parameters": {
             "param1": "value1"
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

4. **Proper JSON Escaping in Shell**:
   - When using the JSON method, proper escaping in the shell is critical.
   - Using single quotes around the entire JSON helps avoid most escaping issues.
   - For complex JSON with nested quotes, consider storing the JSON in a file and using:
     ```bash
     claude mcp add-json server-name "$(cat path/to/server-config.json)"
     ```

5. **Important Tips for JSON Registration**:
   - Ensure the JSON conforms to the MCP server configuration schema.
   - The `name` field in the JSON should match the name used in the `add-json` command.
   - The `command` field must point to an executable that exists and has proper permissions.
   - The `schema` section is crucial for proper parameter validation and documentation.
   - The `examples` section helps users understand how to use the MCP service.

### Next Steps

After this simplification:
1. Start Claude Code and run `/mcp` to check if the hello-world MCP is connecting properly.
2. If there are still connection issues, check:
   - File permissions on the hello-world executable
   - Whether the executable exists at the specified path
   - Process logs in `/var/www/mcp/logs/`

By focusing on just the Hello World MCP, we can better isolate and resolve any remaining connection issues.

## MCP Documentation Reference

### Set up Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. For more details, see the MCP documentation.

> Use third party MCP servers at your own risk. Make sure you trust the MCP servers, and be especially careful when using MCP servers that talk to the internet, as these can expose you to prompt injection risk.

### Configure MCP servers

When to use: You want to enhance Claude's capabilities by connecting it to specialized tools and external servers using the Model Context Protocol.

#### 1. Add an MCP Stdio Server

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add <name> <command> [args...]

# Example: Adding a local server
claude mcp add my-server -e API_KEY=123 -- /path/to/server arg1 arg2
```

#### 2. Manage your MCP servers

```bash
# List all configured servers
claude mcp list

# Get details for a specific server
claude mcp get my-server

# Remove a server
claude mcp remove my-server
```

**Tips:**
- Use the `-s` or `--scope` flag to specify where the configuration is stored:
  - `local` (default): Available only to you in the current project (was called project in older versions)
  - `project`: Shared with everyone in the project via .mcp.json file
  - `user`: Available to you across all projects (was called global in older versions)
- Set environment variables with `-e` or `--env` flags (e.g., `-e KEY=value`)
- Configure MCP server startup timeout using the `MCP_TIMEOUT` environment variable (e.g., `MCP_TIMEOUT=10000 claude` sets a 10-second timeout)
- Check MCP server status any time using the `/mcp` command within Claude Code
- MCP follows a client-server architecture where Claude Code (the client) can connect to multiple specialized servers

### Understanding MCP server scopes

When to use: You want to understand how different MCP scopes work and how to share servers with your team.

#### 1. Local-scoped MCP servers

The default scope (local) stores MCP server configurations in your project-specific user settings. These servers are only available to you while working in the current project.

```bash
# Add a local-scoped server (default)
claude mcp add my-private-server /path/to/server

# Explicitly specify local scope
claude mcp add my-private-server -s local /path/to/server
```

#### 2. Project-scoped MCP servers (.mcp.json)

Project-scoped servers are stored in a .mcp.json file at the root of your project. This file should be checked into version control to share servers with your team.

```bash
# Add a project-scoped server
claude mcp add shared-server -s project /path/to/server
```

This creates or updates a .mcp.json file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shared-server": {
      "command": "/path/to/server",
      "args": [],
      "env": {}
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. User-scoped MCP servers

User-scoped servers are available to you across all projects on your machine, and are private to you.

```bash
# Add a user server
claude mcp add my-user-server -s user /path/to/server
```

**Tips:**
- Local-scoped servers take precedence over project-scoped and user-scoped servers with the same name
- Project-scoped servers (in .mcp.json) take precedence over user-scoped servers with the same name
- Before using project-scoped servers from .mcp.json, Claude Code will prompt you to approve them for security
- The .mcp.json file is intended to be checked into version control to share MCP servers with your team
- Project-scoped servers make it easy to ensure everyone on your team has access to the same MCP tools
- If you need to reset your choices for which project-scoped servers are enabled or disabled, use the `claude mcp reset-project-choices` command

### Add MCP servers from JSON configuration

When to use: You have a JSON configuration for a single MCP server that you want to add to Claude Code.

#### 1. Add an MCP server from JSON

```bash
# Basic syntax
claude mcp add-json <name> '<json>'

# Example: Adding a stdio server with JSON configuration
claude mcp add-json weather-api '{"type":"stdio","command":"/path/to/weather-cli","args":["--api-key","abc123"],"env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}}'
```

#### 2. Verify the server was added

```bash
claude mcp get weather-api
```

**Tips:**
- Make sure the JSON is properly escaped in your shell
- The JSON must conform to the MCP server configuration schema
- You can use `-s global` to add the server to your global configuration instead of the project-specific one
